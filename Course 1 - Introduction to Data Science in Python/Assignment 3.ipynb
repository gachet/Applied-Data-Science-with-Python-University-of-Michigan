    "# Assignment 3 - More Pandas\n",
    "This assignment requires more individual learning then the last one did - you are encouraged to check out the [pandas documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) to find functions or methods you might not have used yet, or ask questions on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and tag them as pandas and python related. And of course, the discussion forums are open for interaction with your peers and the course staff."

The first two columns are unneccessary, so you should get rid of them, and you should change the column labels so that the columns are:\n",
